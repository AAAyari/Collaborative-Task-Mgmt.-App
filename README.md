# Collaborative Task Management Application

## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative task management application designed to help teams plan, organize, assign, and monitor tasks within projects. The application supports collaboration between multiple users, improves task visibility, and facilitates structured project execution.

The system was developed as part of an academic project, combining software development with modeling and design practices using UML.

---

## Programming Languages and Technologies

The application is built using the following languages and technologies:

* Java for backend development and business logic
* SQL for database design and data management
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface
* UML for system analysis and software design

Frameworks, libraries, and tools may vary depending on the project configuration.

---

## UML Design and Modeling

The project includes several UML components used during the analysis and design phases to model the system structure and behavior:

* Use case diagrams to describe system functionalities and user interactions
* Class diagrams to represent system structure, entities, attributes, and relationships
* Sequence diagrams to illustrate interactions between system components over time
* Activity diagrams to model workflows and task lifecycles
* Gantt and planning diagrams to support project scheduling and coordination

These UML diagrams were used to ensure consistency between requirements, design, and implementation.

## Key Features

* User authentication and role management
* Project creation and management
* Task creation, assignment, and tracking
* Task status monitoring (to-do, in progress, completed)
* Collaboration between team members
* Progress tracking and reporting

## How to Run the Application

1. Extract or clone the project directory.
2. Configure the database connection.
3. Install required dependencies.
4. Run the backend server.
5. Launch the frontend interface.
6. Access the application locally through a web browser.

Exact steps depend on the selected frameworks and environment.

## User Roles

The system may include the following roles:

* Project manager
* Team member
* Administrator

Each role has different permissions related to project and task management.

---

## Limitations

* The application focuses on core task management features
* Real-time features may be limited or not implemented
* Scalability depends on the deployment environment

---

## Future Enhancements

* Real-time notifications
* Advanced analytics and reporting
